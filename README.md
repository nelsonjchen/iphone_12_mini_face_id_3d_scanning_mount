# iPhone 12 mini Face ID Mirror Mount

This is a 3D forward facing face ID scanner through a mirror mount for use with [Heges 3D Scanner](https://hege.sh/). 

The iPhone 12 mini is sold cheap on eBay. Mine is battery damaged, non-OEM screen, and looks like it has been chewed on by a dog. But the Face ID scanner still works!
